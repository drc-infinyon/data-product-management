# Data Product management
Managing data as a product has been recently positioned as a novel concept in recent years.

Ironically, this push to treat data as a product comes at a time when the notion of product management in tech is going through reforms.

For folks like me who have managed physical consumer products and have background and interest outside tech, this seems like a correction. Product management in tech went through a period of confusion, deconstruction, and is now normalizing based on the first principles.

As data product management becomes a thing, its time for more chaos and confusion through the forming storming and norming of this new iteration of product management.

The purpose of this document is to align with the first principles of product thinking and product management to inform a clear flow of data product management.
