## Why is it relevant & why now?
Data products and platforms are hard to build.
The demand for data product managers is growing rapidly.
In the past 10 years, hiring data roles have become more difficult.

There is a major gap in proper product managment patterns which are focused on customer and business.

The handful of patterns available are over indexed on tools and platforms and has failed to deliver a delightful customer experience and subpar returns to the businesses.

## How is data product management unique?

In the world of software products the key concept is interactions and transactions. The development of software products typically involve a couple of forms of databases, a user interface, and server infrastructure.

In the world of data products we have events, transactions, predictive algorithms, analytics and insights, artifical intelligence etc.

Data products and platforms typically involve the software stack and message queues, data warehouses, data lakes, feature stores, CPU and GPU optimized servers, data profiling, visualization, annotation tools and more. There are a lot of different tools for different data processing needs.

The economics of data products require deeper thinking about infrastructure, tooling, platforms etc. A systematic view of product management is necessary in the context of data to account for the added complexity of the tools, frameworks, and workflows specific to data.

## Roadmap
The roadmap is a useful artefact to communicate strategy and execution milesontes. The data product managers roadmap predominantly revolves around the journey of the data, the needs of the consumer, the strategy and economics of the business. The two most important guardrails of the data product management roadmap is the unit economics and time constraints.

Here is a representation of the data product management journey:
* Strategy: Business context, Org Design, Communication Preferences, Culture, Risk Appetite, Runway, Org Politics, IP, Build Vs Buy, Open Source outlook

**Motivation:**
I have been in a number of data roles since 2009. Have developed products in advanced analytics & insights, applied artificial intelligence & machine learning and packaged datasets as a product. Each of these product portfolios have delivered a combined $200M business value. Since 2014, I have grown in product management roles and delivered data products and platforms in Healthcare & Life Sciences, Public Safety & Surveillance, Automotive, and eCommerce.

As a Head of Product at early stage startups and a Director of Product at a growth stage scale up, I have experienced the challenge of hiring and developing product managers for data teams. There are multiple communities and conversations where people have shared similar challenges as well as asked about resources to level up. Based on the market demand and the desire of the people asking questions it makes sense to share the patterns refined over the last decade of practice and set a direction for the Product Management function in Data Orgs.
