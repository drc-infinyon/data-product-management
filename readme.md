## How is data product management unique?

In the world of software products the key concept is interactions and transactions. The development of software products typically involve a couple of forms of databases, a user interface, and server infrastructure.

In the world of data products we have events, transactions, predictive algorithms, analytics and insights, artifical intelligence etc. Data products and platforms typically involve the software stack and message queues, data warehouses, data lakes, feature stores, CPU and GPU optimized servers, data profiling, visualization, annotation tools and more. There are a lot of different tools for different data processing needs.

The economics of data products require deeper thinking about infrastructure, tooling, platforms etc. A systematic view of data product management is a result of years of digital transformation and it is mature enough to have its own flavour of tools, frameworks, and workflows.

**Motivation:** I have been in various data roles since 2009. Have developed products in advanced analytics & insights, applied artificial intelligence & machine learning and packaged datasets as a product. Since 2014, I have been in product management roles of data products and platforms in Healthcare & Life Sciences, Public Safety & Surveillance, Automotive, and eCommerce. As a a Head of Product 2 early stage startups and a Director of Product at a growth stage scale up, I have experienced the challenge of hiring and developing product managers for data teams. There are multiple communities and conversations where people have shared similar challenges as well as asked about resources to level up. Based on the market demand and the desire of the people asking questions it makes sense to share the patterns refined over the last decade of practice and set a direction for the Product Management function in Data Orgs.
