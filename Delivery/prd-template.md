  <summary>Product Development Contract</summary>
The purpose of this contract is to outline the product development and delivery contract to enable:
- Clarity
- Alignment
- Collaboration

The product development contract is supposed to tackle the following functionality:
1. Capture user feedback
2. Clearly describe the problem
3. Align on the solution
4. Define the scope and timeline for execution

The PRD contract is broken down into 3 documents and 2 Github Issues aligned with the functionality described above.
1. Issue on Github describing the feature which will be included in the public roadmap
2. PRD in the private roadmap repository
3. Concept in the private roadmap repository
4. RFD in the private roadmap repository
5. Issue on Github to track the execution

A critical element in the contract is the alignment between the PRD, the Concept, and the RFD which is going to inform both the public roadmap issue as well as the tracking issue.

We need to have the user interface validated by the user before we start building.
