# Data product pitch outline

### All businesses operate based on 3 main principles

*These 3 principles exist in the context of different organizational culture and politics.*

- Business Strategy
    - Why does the business/organization exist?
    - What is the operating model of the business/organization?

- Staff
    - What are the skills and roles needed to execute against the business strategy?
    - What is the organizational design to implement the business operating model and deliver products?

- Economics
    - What is the value or impact of the product in terms of time, money?
    - What are the operating expenses - cost of infrastructure, software, cost of staff?

### All product follow 3 basic principles

*These 3 principles manifest differently for different categories of products.*

- Demand: *Also known as customer desirability*
    - The demand exist in the context of jobs, goals, expectations, problems, challenges.
    - In almost all cases there is a set of use cases, workflows, alternatives or workarounds.

- State of the art: *Also known as technical feasibility*
    - The state of the art is the current baseline of how existing alternatives meet the market demand.
    - Includes the usability, and performance baseline of the current solution.

- Opportunity: *Also known as business viability*
    - The business opportunity is the indicative impact of a better solution that can be measured by time, money, and associated benefits like lives and environmental impact improved.
    - It is better to measure inputs->outputs->outcomes in order to have a clear representation of the costs and the relationship between outputs and outcomes.

### Prompts for crafting data product communications
Based on the context, the following prompts are relevant to craft product pitches, product requirement documents, experiments, and other relevant documentation concerning data products.

> For Data Products, all of the basic questions below will involve data sources, data acquisition, data processing, data analysis and modelling, data consumption patterns.

> Measure capacity in person days/weeks. Measure cost of capacity in the same grain. Remember to always think and communicate in time boxes.

#### Demand
Describe the demand for your idea:
- What is the use case?
- Who is the ideal customer?
- What is their current workflow?
- What is the frequency of the use case?
- How often do they run the current workflow?
- What is the ideal customer trying to accomplish?
- What business decisions are relying on the workflow?
- What are the gaps and challenges in the current workflow?
- How valuable are the business decisions and what is their impact?

#### State of the art
Describe the state of the art for your idea:
- How much capacity and budget does the workflow consume?
- What are the current baseline metrics of the workflow?
- How effective/efficient is the current workflow?(1-10)
- What are the demerits of the workflow?
- What are the merits of the workflow?

#### Opportunity

Describe the opportunity for your idea:
- What 10X impact can your data product have on the business?
- How would it improve the effectiveness/efficiency?(1-10)
- How would it impact the metrics of the workflow?
- How would it impact the gaps in the workflow?
- How would it improve the customers lives?
- How much capacity and budget is needed?

#### Scoping Data Products
The basic logic of prioritization is to increase impact. Increasing impact is a function of increasing value and efficiency. Increasing efficiency implies reducing waste and duplication.

To scope data initiatives to maximize impact answer the following questions:

*All rating questions are on a scale of 1-10, higher is better, easier, more valuable etc.*

- Rate the level of accessibility of the data assets?
- Rate the quality of the data assets? (completeness, consistency, granularity, distribution, skew)
- Rate the simplicity of the workflow to collect, process, and make use of the data?
- Rate the value of the business case? ($$$, time savings, business impact)

For a larger initiative spanning multiple iterations, decompose the overall scope of the data products use case into smaller parts, and apply the same logic as above.
